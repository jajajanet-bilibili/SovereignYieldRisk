**Sovereign Bond Yield Volatility Analysis**

This project analyzes the volatility of sovereign bond yields using GARCH models. It examines the impact of different regimes (Pre-COVID, COVID, and Recovery periods) on sovereign bond yields for various countries (China and US).

**Installation**

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sovereign-bond-analysis.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd sovereign-bond-analysis
3. Install the necessary Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Once the project is installed, you can run the analysis on the sovereign bond data. To execute the script:

python main.py --data /path/to/your/data.csv --model GARCH

Replace /path/to/your/data.csv with the path to your sovereign bond yield data file. The --model flag allows you to choose the model (e.g., GARCH) for volatility analysis.

**Features**
GARCH Model Implementation: Forecast volatility of sovereign bond yields using GARCH models.
Regime-based Analysis: Analyze different market regimes such as Pre-COVID, COVID, and Recovery.
Visualization: Generate plots to visualize volatility trends for sovereign bonds.
